Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of various data structures and algorithms using Python, focusing on stacks, queues, and linked lists. It includes functionalities for managing and visualizing these data structures, with a user interface for interacting with them.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The primary programming language used for implementation.
ReportLab: A library used for generating PDF reports and visualizations.
pickle: A module used for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
datetime: A module for handling dates and times.
Data Structures and Algorithms
Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports the following operations:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
Reverse: Reverses the order of elements in the stack.
Implementation
Push: stack.append(element)
Pop: stack.pop()
Peek: stack[-1]
Reverse: stack[::-1]
Queue Using Two Stacks
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This implementation uses two stacks to simulate queue behavior:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
Sort: Sorts the elements in ascending or descending order.
Implementation
Enqueue: Pushes elements onto stack1.
Dequeue: Moves elements from stack1 to stack2 to reverse the order and then pops from stack2.
Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next. It supports the following operations:

Insert: Adds a new node to the list.
Delete: Removes a node from the list.
Display: Shows all elements in the list.
Implementation
Insert: Adds a new node and adjusts pointers.
Delete: Updates pointers to remove a node.
Display: Traverses the list and prints each node.
Visualization and History
Stack Visualization
Function: draw_stack(stack, filename='stack.pdf')
Purpose: Creates a visual representation of the stack with nodes and arrows showing connections.
History Management
Save History: Uses pickle to save stack operations and their history.
Load History: Retrieves saved history from a file.
PDF Report: Uses ReportLab to generate a PDF report of the stack's history with timestamps.
