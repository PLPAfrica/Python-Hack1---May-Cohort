# Overview

This project contains three separate implementations demonstrating basic data structures and algorithms in Python. The focus is on using stacks, queues, and linked lists for specific tasks.

1. Reverse a String Using a Stack
Purpose: Reverse a given string using the Last In, First Out (LIFO) property of a stack.

How to Use:

- Create a stack object.
- Call the reverse_string function with the stack and the string you want to reverse.
- The function returns the reversed string.

# 2. Implement a Queue Using Two Stacks
Purpose: Implement a queue using two stacks, allowing enqueue and dequeue operations to follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
How to Use:
- Create a QueueWithStacks object.
- Use the enqueue method to add elements to the queue.
- Use the dequeue method to remove and return the front element of the queue. 

# 3. Find the Maximum Element in a List Using a Linked List
Purpose: Find the maximum element in a list that is implemented as a singly linked list.

How to Use:
- Create a LinkedList object.
- Use the append method to add elements to the linked list.
- Call the find_max method to find and return the maximum element in the list.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

# Running the Code
Simply run the Python scripts containing each implementation to test the functionality. The provided examples demonstrate how to use each implementation.
