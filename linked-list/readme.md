# Find the Maximum Element in a List Using a Linked List

This project demonstrates how to implement a singly linked list in Python and find the maximum element in the list. The code is organized into a `LinkedList` class, which contains methods to append elements to the list and to find the maximum element.

## How It Works

### 1. Linked List Implementation

The linked list is a data structure where each element, called a node, contains some data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The first node is referred to as the head, and the last node points to `None`, indicating the end of the list.

### 2. Node Class

The `Node` class is used to create individual nodes of the linked list. Each node has two attributes:

- `data`: Stores the value of the node.
- `next`: Stores the reference to the next node in the linked list.

### 3. LinkedList Class

The `LinkedList` class manages the linked list. It has the following key methods:

- **`__init__`**: Initializes an empty linked list with a `head` set to `None`.

- **`append(data)`**: This method adds a new node to the end of the linked list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head of the list. Otherwise, it traverses the list to find the last node and links it to the new node.

- **`find_max()`**: This method finds and returns the maximum value in the linked list. It initializes a variable `max_value` to the smallest possible number (`-infinity`) and then traverses the list, updating `max_value` whenever it finds a larger value.

### 4. Example Usage

The example at the bottom of the script demonstrates how to use the `LinkedList` class. We create a linked list, append a few numbers to it, and then call `find_max()` to determine the largest number.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use the code:

```python
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(3)
ll.append(1)
ll.append(4)
ll.append(2)
print(ll.find_max())  # Output: 4
```
